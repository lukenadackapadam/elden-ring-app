# Elden Ring App

## Introduction

This application simply retrieves data on a given boss that is requested by the user. Data returned includes information relevant to the specific boss such as name, image, region, description, location, drops(loot), and HP(Health Points). This was my first time at creating a full stack application and I only chose to include a GET request in this scenario.
